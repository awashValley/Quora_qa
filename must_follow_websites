    1.  www.github.com - for a million reasons, version control || file storage || collaboration || hosting gh-pages || storing documentation - take your pick the list goes on...
    2.  www.stackoverflow.com - for code that doesn't work
    3.  www.quora.com I suppose, for when my decision making breaks 
    4.  www.c9.io - technically this is software but as I use it every day, and the docs/forums...
    5.  www.codepen.io - to test out front-end stuff
    6.  www.laracasts.com - Netflix for developers!
    7.  www.scotch.io (Really well written web dev articles!).
    8.  www.npmjs.com - this would be composer for php or ruby gems for ruby
    9.  www.css-tricks.com for whenever I want to hack or fix a front-end layout issue / Svg animations / build tools... All really well explained by the amazing Chris Coyier!
    10. www.shoptalkshow.com - technically actually an mp3 rather than a www... But I still visit it weekly so I'll throw it in!
